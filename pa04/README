PROGRAM INFORMATION :

The obejctive of this program was to implement Prims Minimum Spanning Tree and Dijskstra Shortest Path algorithms using priority queue and adjwgtvec. To do so we had to make two new data structures for use in the program; PriorityQueue (MinPQ) and AdjWgt (Essentially the edges that are pushed onto certain indices of the adjwgtvec)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO RUN :

1. make
2. make greedy04
3. ./greedy04 (-P or -D) (Source Vector <= n) (INPUT FILE)

HOW TO MAKE .o FILES :
1. make 

HOW TO RETURN DIRECTORY TO ORIGINAL STATE :
1. make clean

IF N > 20 :
1. THE OUTPUT FILE WILL BE PUT INTO THE FILE CALLED out_file.txt
2. cat out_file.txt (TO OPEN)

begin.test - correct input
hope.in - large test file
